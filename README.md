This project uses the open source Java framework [Apache Jena](https://jena.apache.org/).

main.java has some serious issues and will not work as I intendet to.
answer.java is just to test apache jena and rdf. I have integrated some questions but only hard-coded!

In the moment there are some issues with the way of saving data. So, please consider this when you push more code, because it will eventually be deleted.
